# Citely

Paste citations in bulk, sort them alphabetically, and copy or download the results. Everything runs in your browser.

## Features
- Paste citations in any format; we split by new lines, bullets, numbered lists, and semicolons.
- Case-insensitive alphabetical sorting.
- Option to ignore leading articles (A, An, The) for sorting.
- Optional remove duplicates (case-insensitive) while keeping the first occurrence.
- Optional “Format as reference list” view with hanging indents for multi-line wrapping.
- Copy to clipboard or download as .txt.

## Usage
Open `index.html` in your browser. No build or server is required.

1. Paste your citations into the input area.
2. Choose options (ignore articles, case-insensitive, remove duplicates, format as reference list).
3. Click Alphabetize. Copy or Download the sorted list.

## Notes
- No data leaves your device.
- If your list uses unusual separators, try putting one citation per line for best results.

## Development
It’s a plain static site: `index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`.
